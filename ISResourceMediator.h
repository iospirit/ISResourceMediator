/*!
Change the application's use of the resource to match the definition of the supplied ISResourceMediatorResourceAccess value.

The app will only receive the values kISResourceMediatorResourceAccessNone and the value of the preferredAccess-property.

When you're done performing the changes, call the supplied completion handler to tell the mediator about the result:

kISResourceMediatorResultSuccess if you made the change or your app is already accessing the resource accordingly

kISResourceMediatorResultError if an error occured in trying to make the change

kISResourceMediatorResultDeny if you don't want to make the change.

IMPORTANT: Because ISResourceMediator takes measures to ensure that this delegate method is not called again before the completionHandler() has signaled completion, ISResourceMediator will stop working if you don't call the completionHandler in your code.

@property(assign,nonatomic) ISResourceMediatorAccessPressure accessPressure; //!< A ISResourceMediatorAccessPressure value indicating how strongly the application needs access to the resource. The stronger an application needs a resource, the higher this value. The idea here is to follow the user's intent in running different applications targeting the same resource: if a user f.ex. installs a media player supporting a remote, but also runs an application to enhance that remote, it's highly likely the user wants the enhancer to take control. Using the pressure value allows the ISResourceMediator instances to automatically release access and claim access to the resource in a way that fits this. Please see the descriptions of the available ISResourceMediatorAccessPressure values to determine which one is right for your application. If unsure, don't set this property. A default value of kISResourceMediatorAccessPressureOptional will then be used.
