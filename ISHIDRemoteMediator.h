/*
	ISHIDRemoteMediator can be used to track the use of the Apple Remote by other applications.
	
	Features:
	- adds status data from apps using HIDRemote (NOTE: this class does NOT broadcast status
	  back to HIDRemote. That would be done by the HIDRemote instance that you use to access
	  the Apple Remote in your app - and that is managed by ISHIDRemoteMediator)
	- watch the resource(s) in IOKit and track its users (for apps not using HIDRemote)
	- omits OS X daemons accessing the Apple Remote in shared mode (so they're not turning up
	  as users of the resource)
